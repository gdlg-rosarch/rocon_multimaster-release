Description: The python redis client has a minor issue - it hangs on ctrl-c. This is a locally patched version that we can use directly until it is patched upstream. https://github.com/robotics-in-concert/rocon_multimaster/issues/30 Note - this package has to be named 'redis' so we can conveniently import as if we were using the python-redis package.
